      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Kin Kam Zhao but everyone can call me Kam.  This summer, 
        Iâ€™ve taken the first steps in shifting career paths by exploring computer 
        science courses at Bergen Community College. While I have an undergraduate 
        degree in Finance, I also have years of experience as a restaurant 
        manager, cook, and delivery driver. Rutgers Coding Boot Camp will provide
        me with a better understanding of coding.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from New York City but raised in New Jersey.  </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are playing ping pong, eating great food, and learning
        new things.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a job where I will learn new things and challenge myself. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in North Arlington, NJ.  </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As assistant restaurant manager I always come to ask myself how I can improve our
      website so that it becomes better integrated with out systems and make our 
      jobs easier to do.  As a web developer I will be able to do just that. </p>
